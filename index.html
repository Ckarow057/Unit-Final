                    <h3>My Journey</h3>
                    <p>I started making this recipe during the Covid-19 Lockdown as a way to explore my newfound love of
                        cooking. I always liked making cookies with my mom, but they got way too easy and I wanted to
                        make
                        something other than cookies. I believe this was one of the first things I tried. I failed
                        miserably my
                        first time around. Yeast is a hard thing to work with if you haven't done it before. But after a
                        while,
                        it became second nature. This was essentially a gateway drug to other baked goods for me. After
                        this, I
                        started experimenting with other recipes and techniques. I have made calzones, chicago style
                        deep dish
                        pizza, hotdog buns, cinnamon rolls, and sandwich bread. It pushed me to learn something new, and
                        now my
                        family keeps throwing other crazy recipes at me.</p>

                    <h3>About Hokkaido Milk Bread</h3>
                    <p>This recipe is for Hokkaido Milk Bread Burger Buns. Hokkaido milk bread is a type of Japanese
                        bread
                        known for its soft, fluffy texture and slightly sweet flavor. The key to achieving this texture
                        lies in
                        the use of a technique called tangzhong, which involves cooking a portion of flour, water, and
                        milk into a
                        pre-hydrated paste. This recipe can be a multi-purpose recipe, as you can also make dinner
                        rolls. The
                        ingredient portions are slightly different, but the process is the same. These buns are perfect
                        for
                        burgers, sandwiches, or simply enjoyed on their own with a bit of butter. One of my favorite
                        things to do is to make steak sandwiches with gouda and aioli alongside the buns.</p>

                    <li>1 tablespoon instant yeast</li>

                    <li>It is important that the butter is unsalted. If there is extra salt, it will mess with the

                    <li>In a small saucepan, whisk together the bread flour, water, and milk until smooth.</li>
                    <li>Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until the mixture thickens to a pudding-like
                        consistency (about 3-5 minutes).</li>
                    <li>Remove from heat and let it cool to room temperature.</li>

                <h3>Prepare the Dough:</h3>
                <ol class="instruction-list">
                    <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine the warm milk and instant yeast. Let it sit for about 10 minutes
                        until bloomed.</li>
                    <li>Add the bread flour, salt, and sugar to the bowl. Mix together until well combined.</li>
                    <li>Add the cooled tangzhong and the eggs to the bowl and mix until fully incorporated.</li>
                    <li>After <strong>everything</strong> is fully combined, add the softened butter one tablespoon at
                        a time and mix until fully incorporated.</li>
                    <li>Knead the dough until it becomes smooth and elastic (about 10-15 minutes by hand or 8-10 minutes
                        using a stand mixer with a dough hook).</li>
                    <li>Place the dough in a lightly greased bowl, cover it with a damp cloth or plastic wrap, and let
                        it rise in a warm place for about 1-1 1/2 hours or until it doubles in size.
                        <div class="instruction-note">An oven with the light on is a good place for this.</div>

            </div>

                <h3>Shape and Bake the Bread:</h3>
                <ol class="instruction-list">
                    <li>Punch down the risen dough to release any air bubbles.</li>
                    <li>Divide the dough into 8 equal portions. Roll each portion into a ball.</li>
                    <li>Place the dough balls on a greased baking sheet. Once all are shaped, cover with another baking
                        sheet or plastic wrap. Let proof for 2 hours.
                        <div class="instruction-note">While the dough is proofing, preheat the oven to 375°F.</div>
                    </li>
                    <li>Once the dough has proofed, brush the tops with the beaten egg mixture (one egg and a splash of
                        milk) and sprinkle with sesame seeds if desired.</li>
                    <li>Bake the buns in the preheated oven for 15-20 minutes or until golden brown.</li>
                    <li>Let cool for about a half hour. If you cut them before cool, they will dry out and crumble. The
                        crumb will also not be very good and consistent.</li>
